So instead of wasting your time with useless certificates, work on some personal projects to train your skills. Here are some ideas what you could do:

Build your personal page. Or where else are you going to show your work?
Get inspiration from others, explore their work and recreate it.
Make up various clients. Write down their needs and problems and build pages that solve those problems.
Work for actual people, explore their needs and build pages that solve their actual problems.
